# Seminar: Computational Methods for Image Reconstruction

This repo contains my session slides, code exercise, and session report on the topic of "image restoration". 
The lecture is based on the book "Image Reconstruction: Algorithms and Analysis" by Jeffrey Fessler. 
You can see the lecture content in the chapter of [Image Restoration](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/book/c-restore.pdf)
